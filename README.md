# Safar-E-Tourism
The background of our prototype - Safar, is to develop a web-based on the effectiveness of using QR codes for authenticating an E-ticket. By providing for a simple and sophisticated system to generate an E- Ticket, it will be able to increase ticket sales. Through our website, we allow the user to book a ticket for a particular monument on a particular day. After booking a ticket, the user is directed to the payment portal where the money transaction is carried out using the Razor Pay testing API. If the payment is successful, an E-Ticket containing the QR is generated which is sent to the email of the tourist. The tourist then scans this QR code at the monument to gain entry into the monument. Our website also contains an admin portal where the live count of visitors with their credentials and the history of tourists for that monument is stored. All the user data will be encrypted using a novel cryptographic approach before it is saved to the database, to provide added security. As tourism accounts for 7% of Indiaâ€™s GDP, Safar aims to attract tourists by giving them an all-round, complete experience. Safar not only reduces the time to wait for a long duration in queues but also makes the process of visiting a monument seamless and hassle free. Developed using React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Django, Safar is instrumental to multiple domains such as Tourism, Software Developers for collecting data, our country and the world too. It will give a boost to the heritage and culture of our country and also ensure a greener and cleaner economy.
